# Devopshobbies helm generic chart

![DevopsHobbies helm generic chart](.github/assets/helm-generic-chart.png)
This chart is created to be used inside devopshobbies & kaiser-io devops operations.

## How it works:

The use-case is pretty simple and you can start using this by fetching the chart. Also, there is one `values.example.yaml` defined for you which you can check and have a look at to find out how to set the variables.

## How release and versioning work:

The versioning and releasing logic is so fairly simple, just push a commit on main branch and you have it.
